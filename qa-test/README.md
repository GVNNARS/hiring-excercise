# Task
Using C# and the browser-automation tool of your choice (with Selenium being preferred), write a test that does the following on Amazon:

1. Search for any book (the choice of title is yours)
2. Add the book to the cart

How you structure the test is up to you, but will be taken into account when the code is assessed. Bonus points are available for use of PageObjects, or SpecFlow to structure the tests.

Feel free to add any comments to clarify areas you feel are confusing or that you wish to highlight.
