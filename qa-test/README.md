# Task
Using C# (or Java as a second choice), SpecFlow, and Selenium, your task is to test this scenario on Amazon:
1. Search for any book (the choice of title is yours)
2. Add the book to the cart

# Goal
How you structure the test is up to you, but will be taken into account when the code is assessed. Feel free to add any comments to clarify areas you feel are confusing or that you wish to highlight.
