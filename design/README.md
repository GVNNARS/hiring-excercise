# Task

Create a simple **HTML/CSS** layout using **LESS or SASS** from a [spec](http://www.adbrain.com/assets/images/other/html-css.png).

If you are familiar with Build Tools (e.g. Gulp, Grunt), feel free to use a predefined setup in the [src](https://github.com/adbrain/hiring-excercise/tree/master/design/src) folder. This will not only be a **major plus**, it will also save you a fair amount of time.

## Goal

To display a strong command of the web (coding), **modern** HTML/CSS layout building, the ability to use a CSS precompiler (and optionally a Version Control System and Build Tools).

## Specification

See the spec mock [here](http://www.adbrain.com/assets/images/other/html-css.png).

- do not worry about browser support, aim for latest Chrome

Generally:

- try to come up with a modern, simple, non-hacky solution (avoid JS if possible)
- feel free to use Google and Stack Overflow heavily if in any need
